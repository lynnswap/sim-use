/// A simulator that is shut down and re-booted under the same UDID
/// passes `makeSession`'s `state == .booted` re-check, so the cached
/// `FBSimulatorHID` — whose mach port belongs to the previous boot —
/// is handed back and every perform fails. The daemon's stale-simulator
/// cleanup never fires for these failures (the message doesn't match
/// `DaemonErrorKind.isStaleSimulatorMessage`), which used to poison the
/// UDID until the daemon restarted.
///
/// Every perform failure therefore invalidates the cached connection:
/// that is cheap and safe, because the next command rebuilds it. The
/// retry decision is stricter. `FBSimulatorHIDEvent` composites (tap,
/// swipe, type) deliver one mach message per sub-event and short-circuit
/// on the first failure, so a blind re-perform could double-apply
/// sub-events that were already delivered. Retry is gated on
/// dead-transport errors only, where delivery to the currently-booted
/// simulator instance provably never happened:
///
/// - `mach_msg_send` returning `MACH_SEND_INVALID_DEST` means the kernel
///   refused the message — the port died with the previous boot and the
///   failing sub-event reached nothing. Earlier sub-events of the same
///   composite either failed the same way (port dead from the start,
///   the reboot-window case) or were delivered to the *previous* boot,
///   which is gone; re-performing against the current boot cannot
///   double-apply on any live UI. SimulatorKit's
///   `SimDeviceLegacyHIDClient.HIDError` renders this case as
///   "Mach port invalid, device disconnected" (verified against the
///   Xcode 26.x binary).
/// - A client that never obtained its HID event port renders as
///   "Mach port not connected, device may not be ready yet"; nothing
///   was ever sent through it.
/// - FBSimulatorControl's own "Cannot Connect, HID client has already
///   been disposed of" is emitted before any send by construction.
///
/// Every other message — including SimulatorKit's generic
/// "Mach return error <code>" (e.g. a send timeout that can hit the
/// middle of a composite while earlier touches were delivered) — gets
/// `invalidateOnly`: the current command fails, the next one self-heals
/// against a fresh connection.
///
/// Error text alone is not sufficient once a composite has acknowledged a
/// touch primitive. `recover` therefore also requires the caller's
/// `wholeEventRetryIsSafe` fact; acknowledged touch input is never replayed.
